pardon my poor markdown

Update this description when I remember to

Hplatform
made a checkCollisionTop / Bottom for this in Collideable
hitting bottom propels player downwards
hitting top = jump

Splatform
player location set to top or bottom of platform depending on landing
sticks to top/bottom until player complete length is moved off side of platform
jumps when moved off side

Target
constructor now generates a random size target
points field added, points depend on target size
when shot, points added to score, target will respawn after certain interval

^also when jumpCount == 1 platforms turn red before they disappear
